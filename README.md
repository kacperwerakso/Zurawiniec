# Zurawiniec
Website written in HTML, CSS and PHP, connected to MySQL


# Objective 
The aim of the project was to create a website for a forest/nature reserve in my vicinity,
because this place didn't have a website before and I wanted to create something new.
Presents information photos and curiosities about this location.


# Use
1. Run server(in my case i used xampp)
2. Run the "index.php" file as server in any code editor.(php is needed for this)
3. Create a random account(login and password do not require special parameters, example login and password: "xyz")
4. Ready to browse

# Use when Error
"Warning: Unknown: Failed to open stream: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0
\Users\.....\.vscode\extensions\brapifra.phpserver-3.0.2\src\server\logger.php' (include_path='C:\xampp\php\PEAR') in Unknown on line 0"

Sometimes your antivirus prevents you from doing these things and delete logger.php file.

1. Copy looger.php from logger file in repository
2. Put logger.php in: \Users\.....\.vscode\extensions\brapifra.phpserver-3.0.2\src\server\
3. Ready to browse


# Code 
In the first place the website was written only in html and css, then it was converted to php so that it could connect to MySql

# Eles
